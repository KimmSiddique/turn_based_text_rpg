-> This is a turn based RPG game that took inspiration from Pokemon style battles.
There are 2 players, that can choose from a list of 9 different troops. They each can have
3 troops each, with 1 active troop that battles. When the active troop is defeated, it will
switch to the next troop available. Player who is first to defeat all the opponent's troops wins.

Players can choose 3 different types of troops, fire, water and rock. 
It follows a cyclic relationship in power, where fire deals double damage to rock, rock deals
double damage to water, and water deals double damage to fire. 

Players start off with 1 battlepoint, and as the rounds progress, they gain battlepoints. After
round 5, they gain 2 battlepoints each. Battlepoints are consumed to use the moves of their
troops. Different troops are equipped with different moves that have varying costs.
Players must strategically use their battlepoints if they are to win.

types, for instance a player can take a full team of Blazefangs. Troops are also not exclusive
to each player, players may battle each other using the same troops.
